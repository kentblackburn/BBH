Ph.D. Dissertation: The Spiralling Binary System of Black Holes

University of Florida, 1990

Ph.D. Advisor: Professor Steven Detweiler

Summary:  A novel approach to the numerical analysis of the dynamic system oftwo spiraling black holes is developed using the initial value formalism of general relativity. As the two black holes spiral in on each other they will loseenergy and angular momentum in the form of gravitational radiation. Whenthe amplitude of this gravitational radiation is small enough, the space-timefor the two orbiting black holes can be approximated by a geometry which isunchanging as seen by an observer in a frame of reference co-rotating with thetwo black holes. Then a time-like Killing vector field is assumed to exist overa finite region of the space-time geometry. A variational principle is found forthe total mass of the binary system based on the Hamiltonian of general relativity and is used to study the dynamics and stability of the close orbits. Theemission of gravitational waves within the context of the quadrupole momentapproximation is used to determine the secular evolution of the system. For black holes of equal mass, approximately 3% of the their initial mass, as deter-mined when the two black holes are at rest at large separations, is emitted asgravitational radiation with frequencies less than the quadrupole normal modefrequency of the final coalesced Kerr black hole.
